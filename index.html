      <p>A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but
        using the
        French

        How to Make Croissants
      </h2>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <p>
        1/4 cup (4 Tablespoons; 60g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
        4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled), plus more for rolling/shaping
        1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
        2 teaspoons salt
        1 Tablespoon active dry or instant yeast
        1 and 1/2 cups (360ml) cold whole milk
        Butter Layer
        1 and 1/2 cups (3 sticks; 345g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
        2 Tablespoons (16g) all-purpose flour
        Egg Wash
        1 large egg
        2 Tablespoons (30ml) whole milk
      </p>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>
        1. <strong>Make the dough:</strong> Cut the butter in four 1-Tablespoon pieces and place in the bowl of an
        electric stand mixer
        fitted with
        the dough hook attachment (or you can use a handheld mixer or no mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). Add the
        flour,
        sugar, salt, and yeast. Turn the mixer on low-medium speed to gently combine the ingredients for 1 minute. With
        the
        mixer running, slowly pour in the milk. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium speed and
        beat the
        dough for at least 5 full minutes. (If you don‚Äôt have a mixer, knead by hand for 5 minutes.) The dough will be
        soft. It
        will (mostly) pull away from the sides of the bowl and if you poke it with your finger, it will bounce back. If
        after 5
        minutes the dough is too sticky, keep the mixer running until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured
        silicone
        baking mat lined, lightly floured parchment paper lined, or lightly floured baking sheet. (I highly recommend a
        silicone
        baking mat because you can roll the dough out in the next step directly on top and it won‚Äôt slide all over the
        counter.)
        Gently flatten the dough out, as I do in the video below, and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place
        the entire
        baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. <strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Remove the dough from the refrigerator. I like to keep the dough on the
        silicone baking mat
        when I‚Äôm
        rolling it in this step because the mat is nonstick and it‚Äôs a handy guide for the exact measurement. Begin
        flattening
        out the dough with your hands. You‚Äôre rolling it out into a rectangle in this step, so shaping it with your
        hands first
        helps the stretchy dough. Roll it into a 14√ó10-inch rectangle. The dough isn‚Äôt extremely cold after only 30
        minutes in
        the refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft play-doh. Be precise with the measurement. The dough will want
        to be
        oval shaped, but keep working the edges with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size
        rectangle.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. <strong>Long rest:</strong> Place the rolled out dough back onto the baking sheet (this is why I prefer a
        silicone baking mat
        or
        parchment because you can easily transfer the dough). Cover the rolled out dough with plastic wrap or aluminum
        foil,
        place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 4
        hours or
        overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)
      </p>
      <p>
        5. <strong> Butter layer (begin this 35 minutes before the next step so the butter can chill for 30
          minutes):</strong> In a large bowl using
        a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and flour together
        until
        smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet.
        (Silicone baking mat is preferred because you can easily peel the butter off in the next step.) Using a spoon or
        small
        spatula, smooth out into a 7√ó10-inch rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement. Place the entire
        baking
        sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for 30 minutes. (No need to cover it for only 30 minutes.)
        You want
        the butter layer firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes
        to gently
        soften. The more firm the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the dough in the next step.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. <strong>Laminate the dough:</strong> In this next step, you will be rolling out the dough into a large
        rectangle. Do this on a lightly
        floured counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat. The counter is typically a little cooler
        (great for
        keeping the dough cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you need. Remove both the
        dough and
        butter layers from the refrigerator. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the
        dough
        over it. If the butter wasn‚Äôt an exact 7√ó10-inch rectangle, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the
        edges.
        Seal the dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers. On a lightly floured counter, roll
        the
        dough into a 10√ó20-inch rectangle. It‚Äôs best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of the dough facing
        you, like I
        do in the video below. Use your fingers if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm
        muscle to
        roll. Again, the dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until
        you have
        the correct size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the
        1st
        turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or
        aluminum
        foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn. I usually don‚Äôt have to.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. <strong> 2nd turn:</strong> Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into
        a 10√ó20-inch rectangle, then
        fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. The dough must be refrigerated between
        the 2nd
        and 3rd turn because it has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet,
        cover with
        plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. <strong>3rd turn:</strong>Roll the dough out once again into a 10√ó20-inch rectangle. Fold the dough
        lengthwise into thirds as if you
        were folding a letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. <strong> Long rest: Place the folded dough on the lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum
          foil, and refrigerate
          for 4 hours or overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)</strong> xPlace the folded dough on the lined baking sheet,
        cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate
        for 4 hours or overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)
      </p>
      <p>
        11. At the end of the next step, you‚Äôll need 2 baking sheets lined with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.
        The dough
        is currently on a lined baking sheet in the refrigerator, so you already have 1 prepared!
      </p>
      <p>
        12. <strong> Shape the croissants:</strong> Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured
        counter, roll the dough out into an
        8√ó20-inch rectangle. Use your fingers if you need to. Once again, the dough is very cold, so it will take a lot
        of arm
        muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until
        you
        have the correct size rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each
        skinny
        rectangle will be 4-inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices horizontally, yielding 8 4√ó5-inch rectangles. See photo
        above
        for a visual. Cut each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles. You have 16 triangles now. Work with one
        triangle at a
        time. Using your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch the triangle to be about 8 inches long. Do this gently as you
        do not
        want to flatten the layers. Cut a small slit at the wide end of the triangle, then tightly roll up into a
        crescent shape
        making sure the tip is underneath. Slightly bend the ends in towards each other. Repeat with remaining dough,
        placing
        the shaped croissants on 2 lined baking sheets, 8 per sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil
        and allow
        to rest at room temperature (no warmer‚Äì I suggest keeping on the counter) for 1 hour, then place in the
        refrigerator to
        rest for 1 hour or up to 12 hours. (Or freeze, see freezing instructions.) I prefer the shaped croissants to be
        cold
        going into the oven.
      </p>

      <p>
        13. Preheat oven to 400¬∞F (204¬∞C).
      </p>
      <p>
        14. <strong>Egg wash:</strong> Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Remove the croissants from the
        refrigerator. Brush each lightly with
        egg wash.
      </p>
      <p>
        15. <strong>Bake the croissants:</strong> Bake until croissants are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate the
        pans halfway through baking.
        If croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C).
      </p>
      <p>
        16. Remove croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving. They will
        slightly
        deflate as they cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        17. Croissants taste best the same day they‚Äôre baked. Cover any leftover croissants and store at room
        temperature for a few
        days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also freeze for up to 3 months, then thaw on the counter
        or
        overnight in the refrigerator. Warm up to your liking.
